<h1>Lists Elements</h1>
<p>
    The types of lists include both ordered <strong>(ol)</strong> and unordered <strong>(ul)</strong> any listed items will be listed with the (li) element.
    The (ol) and (ul) elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with (ol) the order is meaningful. <br>
    Example: <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Steps for making your favorite cake!</li>
    <li>Directions to nearest Walmart to get ingredients!</li>
    <li>Rankings of your favorite Football Players!</li>
</ol>
You can change the (ol) where it changes the type of list is ordered like making the numbers become Roman Numeral! <br>
Example using the type inside the (ol) can amke the list look like this:
<ol type="i">
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
</ol>
Other examples are having the alphabet like "a" or "A"!
