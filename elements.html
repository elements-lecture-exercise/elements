<h2>Nested Elements</h2>
<p>
    When an element is nested inside other elements, OR, taking from the javascript language, concatenated, the added element takes on a different type of format.
    This format is viewed by the user in a bold and italicized script to create more awareness of importance of what is being conveyed. <br><br>
    Example: <br><br>
    This element is processed by wrapping the emphasis (em) and strong (strong) tag around the element as such:  <em><strong> BOLD & ITALICIZED</strong>!</em>
    <br><br>
    Good Example of Writing the HTML code: <br><br>
    <em><strong>Hello World!!!</strong></em>
    <br><br>
    Bad Example: <br><br>
    <em><strong>Hello World!!!</em></strong>
    <br><br>
    The <em><strong>Order Of Precedence</strong></em> is not as important, but should be followed to attain the overall goal!

<h2>Lists Elements</h2>
<p>
    The types of lists include both ordered <strong>(ol)</strong> and unordered <strong>(ul)</strong> any listed items will be listed with the (li) element.
    The (ol) and (ul) elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with (ol) the order is meaningful. <br>
    Example: <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Steps for making your favorite cake!</li>
    <li>Directions to nearest Walmart to get ingredients!</li>
    <li>Rankings of your favorite Football Players!</li>
</ol>
You can change the (ol) where it changes the type of list is ordered like making the numbers become Roman Numeral! <br>
Example using the type inside the (ol) can amke the list look like this:
<ol type="i">
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
</ol>
Other examples are having the alphabet like "a" or "A"!
(ul) are used to order a collection of items that don't need to be ordered in any specific way. You can change the style of the bullets
in unordered lists to squares, dots and circles however the type is defined now with CSS using the list-style-type. <br>
Example for good eating habits:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you wash your hands before eating</li>
    <li>You should not have your elbows on the table</li>
</ul>
You can even nest (ul) and (ol) within each other! <br>
Example:
<ol>
    <li>First point</li>
    <li>Second point
        <ul>
            <li>Second point details</li>
            <li>More details
                <ol>
                    <li>details inside</li>
                    <li>details inside</li>
                    <li>details inside</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Third Point</li>
</ol>
